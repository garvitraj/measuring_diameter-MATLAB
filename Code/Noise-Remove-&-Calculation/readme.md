## Removing Noise and Performing Calculation

### In the third step, we have created a MATLAB Script for binarizing one of the images to sharper and clearer contours of various objects present in the image.

### In the last step, we have created a MATLAB Script for calculating the diameter by using getting pixel value and multiplying it with conversion factor to give distance in centimeters and millimeters.
